# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model
**ANN Model **
This repository contains the code and resources for building a Telco Customer Churn Prediction model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's "Telco Churn Prediction" dataset.

**Project Overview**
• Performed data preprocessing & feature engineering, including numeric conversion, encoding categoric variables & scaling features.
• Designed the Multilayer Perceptron with TensorFlow, utilizing ReLU activation in hidden layers & Sigmoid activation in the final layer.
• Implemented a suitable loss function, i.e., Binary Cross-Entropy, and an optimization algorithm, i.e., Adam, to improve the model's performance.
• Observed the model's performance using confusion_matrix and classification_report and achieved an accuracy of over 80%.

**Dependencies**
• Python 3.0
• TensorFlow
• NumPy
• Pandas
• Scikit-Learn
• MatPlotlib
• Seaborn
• Keras

**Dataset**
